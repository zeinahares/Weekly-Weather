# Weekly Weather

## Description

I wanted to create a website that allows me to search for the current and next 5 day weather forecast. I also wanted the website to save my search history and be dynamic with the saved buttons.

Heres the link to try out: https://zeinahares.github.io/Weekly-Weather/


## Installation

N/A

## Usage

When you open the website you are presented with a weather dashboard showing the forecast of Sydney with a search input to search for other cities.
When you search for a city, then you are presented with current and future conditions for that city. That city is also added to the search history and printed on the page.
When you view the current weather conditions for that city, then you are presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed.
If you click on a city in the search history then you are again presented with current and future conditions for that city
